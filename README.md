This is a cellular automaton project.  It's based on John Conway's "game of life".  Mine uses color as another aspect of cell creation.  The cells spawn randomly around the screen and in random colors.  As cells grow next to other cells, they take on a blend of the colors of their parent cells.

Feel free to branch off a new version of this code or use the color blending in another cellular automaton project.
